Pheonix Clone

Welcome to the Pheonix game clone.  A long time ago, when I was just a boy, I had a TI-83 plus graphing calculator.  This thing was amazing, but why was it so amazing?  Because it had the game Pheonix on it and that meant I was gaming in class!

Like many arcade games of that era, Phoenix is a top-down outer space-themed fixed shooter similar to Taito's Space Invaders. The player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen, firing upward. Enemies, typically one of two types of birds, appear on the screen above the player's ship, shooting at it and periodically diving towards it in an attempt to crash into it. In addition to the missiles, the ship is equipped with a shield that can be used to zap any of the alien creatures that attempt to crash into the spaceship. However, the player cannot move while the shield is active, and must wait for a short period (approximately five seconds) before using it again.
